Project Title:
Effects of Air Pollution (or clever name TBD)

Description/Outline:
in scope: minnesota for questions 1-2

Questions to Answer:
1. Is income level and PM exposure coorelated (Census)?
  a. for EPA PM data
  b. for PurpleAir PM data
  
  plots to show: 
  1. gmaps of EPA vs PurpleAir PM2.5 at the same 'time' 
  2. in MN per county do yearly PM2.5 vs yearly income
  
  
2. Is yearly temperature and PM level coorelated? (EPA and OpenWeatherMap)

  plots to show:
  for MN
  1. yearly PM2.5 vs yearly temp
    a. 30 year span
  2. seasonal PM2.5 vs seasonal temp --> maybe for one county
    a. seasonal: Winter/Summer maybe add Spring/Fall

3. Do cities with similar population density have the same level of air pollution?
  Note: Do we want to look outside of MN for this question?
  
  plots to show:
  1. population density vs air quality for MN per county
  2. pick a population density, look for other similar countys with that desnity, then use those countys to get the PM2.5.

Datasets to be used:

1. EPA AirNow API
2. Census API
3. OpenWeatherMap.org API
4. PurpleAir API

Breakdown of Tasks:
per question.

1. Abby
2. Alan
